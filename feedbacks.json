            "good": "The course was absolutely amazing. Even though Gender Studies is a meme (it was to me), Madhurima ma'am taught the course brilliantly. She made it interesting by showing many YouTube videos, documentaries, and things that were happening currently. Classes were very fun to attend and the course structure was very good too, will give you a new perspective on a lot of things. The assignments were well thought out also. All in all, a very interesting course, mostly because of how brilliantly Madhurima ma'am teaches",
            "other": "Attending the classes is a must if you want a good score but they are anyways interesting to attend. Make sure you pay attention to the readings regularly (West and Zimmerman, Talpade are the most important ones). Make decent class notes and revise them the day before the exam and you'll have no problem. Also, make sure you have Grammarly Pro for the assignments."

The course is about the written part of advertising, the theory holds very little value. The group assignments are fun and actually test your creativity. Evals were so easy and generic that I regretted watching the lectures, I would have scored the same regardless of watching them.",
            "other": "Not really, there is no one way you can prepare for it, the only thing is when writing answers in evals where you have to think of ad campaigns, make sure you are consistent with your theme in slogan and the actual idea. That is the only criteria the prof cuts marks on. Don't diverge from the theme. Other than that, not much advise you can give."

I had asked him to use slides since I was getting distracted easily in class using the anonymous feedback portal, and he adapted to it in the class which was within 6 hours of me submitting the feedback. Definitely do pick the course if you're interested in explaining people's behaviors. Btw, the compre was very enjoyable. I had never liked a compre as much as I liked this one. Also, even though the course had 4 assignments, they were the litest possible assignments. You just had to fill out a survey each time and you'd get a full score for submitting the survey. It is disappointing if you were looking to learn more, but it was a savior in the hectic semester. ",
            "bad": "Evals were NOT meant to be MCQ. The compre was amazing. This will probably change with the T1 T2 T3 -> midsems change but yea. Assignments could have been actual assignments, but this change depends on what you define as better (experience vs liteness)",

You could bunk them and still do well by just relying on your gut and the text book, but the lectures would definitely help a lot. p.s. If the midsem is a pure MCQ, search the text book as usually all the answers will be there nearly explicitly."
