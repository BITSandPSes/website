## What is BITSandPSes
A website aimed to help BITSians in finding their ideal PS station. Our attempt to save them from the factories.

BITSandPSes helps you look for your preferred PS Stations by providing a platform where you can find reviews and details about all the PS stations that BITS offers.
There are a set of parameters for everyone while making their preferences list stations. For e.g. location, area of work, last year cutoffs to name a few.
As the lis tof stations is pretty high each year, the work of pulling together all of them in a ranked list becomes quite a tedious task. Apart from this, contacting many seniors and scraping dozens of websites makes the job even more cumbersome.

## The Solution
Through this website, we aim to create a single domain for every student to get all the information and advice they need while going through this process. The list of features we are currently working on ( and looking for contributors too ;) ) :
    <br><br>1. Live Search to go through the station list for every year and find what you are looking for.
    <br>2. Station specific pages shareable through url links, providing all the necessary information.
    <br>3. Discussion forum particular to every station page, so that people can connect and discuss from seniors.
    <br>4. Preference list generator. We will generate the preference list for you according to the priorities you set. Further customization as one wants.
    <br>5. A user interface that is intuitive for everyone. Completely mobile responsive and dynamic.
    <br>6. A database that updates itself automatically through crowd sourcing from oncoming traffic and content managers.
